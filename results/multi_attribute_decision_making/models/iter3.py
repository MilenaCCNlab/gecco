    """Bayesian-like weighted cue integration with calibration, redundancy penalty, momentum, and lapses.

    Mechanism:
    - Computes signed evidence from all cues (expert ratings) favoring B over A.
    - Cue weights are a calibrated linear function of validity, then normalized to form an attention distribution.
    - A redundancy penalty downscales evidence when many cues align strongly (to capture diminishing returns).
    - A momentum term pulls the current choice toward the previous observed decision (choice autocorrelation).
    - The final choice probability is passed through a logistic with inverse temperature and mixed with lapses.

    Parameters (all used):
    - base: [0,1] baseline attention to cues independent of validity (higher -> more uniform weighting).
    - slope: [0,1] calibration slope mapping validity deviations into attention (0 -> validity ignored; 1 -> fully used).
    - rho: [0,1] redundancy penalty; scales down evidence as cues align (0 none; 1 strong penalty).
    - momentum: [0,1] strength of autocorrelation toward previous observed decision (0 none; 1 strong).
    - epsilon: [0,1] lapse rate; mixes the model probability with random choice (0.5).
    - temperature: [0,10] inverse temperature for the logistic choice rule.

    Inputs:
    - decisions: array-like of 0/1 choices (1 = chose B, 0 = chose A).
    - A_feature1..A_feature4: arrays of 0/1 ratings for option A from experts [validities 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6].
    - B_feature1..B_feature4: arrays of 0/1 ratings for option B from the same experts.

    Returns:
    - Negative log-likelihood of observed decisions under the model.

    """Sequential satisficing with position-dependent stopping, asymmetric trust, noisy cue reading, and lapses.

    Mechanism:
    - Cues are inspected in descending validity order (0.9 -> 0.6).
    - When a discriminating cue is encountered at position k, the model stops with probability s_k = 1 - (1 - tau)^k.
      If it does not stop, it continues to search for the next discriminating cue.
    - Discriminating cues that favor B receive a multiplicative boost relative to those favoring A (asymmetry).
    - Cue observation is noisy: with probability nu, the sign of a discriminating cue is flipped.
      We integrate over this noise by using the expected signed impact.
    - If no stop occurs across all discriminating cues, a centered initial bias contributes in logit space.
    - The expected signed evidence across possible stop points is mapped to choice via logistic with temperature and lapses.

    Parameters (all used):
    - tau: [0,1] stopping growth parameter; larger values increase stopping probability at earlier positions.
    - nu: [0,1] perceptual noise; probability of flipping the sign of a discriminating cue upon inspection.
    - asym: [0,1] asymmetric trust; boosts evidence when cue favors B (1+asym) and reduces when favors A (1-asym).
    - init_bias: [0,1] baseline preference for B when no decisive stop occurs; centered around 0.5 and applied in logits.
    - epsilon: [0,1] lapse rate; mixes the model probability with random choice (0.5).
    - temperature: [0,10] inverse temperature scaling of expected evidence.

    Inputs:
    - decisions: array-like of 0/1 choices (1 = chose B, 0 = chose A).

    """Nonlinear cue weighting with power-transformed validities, sparsity, conflict-adaptive temperature, and lapses.

    Mechanism:
    - Cues contribute signed evidence favoring B vs A.
    - Weights are derived from validities via a power transform and a sparsity mixer:
        w_power ‚àù validity^power; normalize to sum=1.
        final_w = (1 - sparsity) * w_power + sparsity * one_hot(argmax(w_power)).
      Thus sparsity shifts mass toward the single most valid cue (winner-take-all) as it increases.
    - A conflict-adaptive mechanism reduces effective temperature when cues strongly disagree.
    - A baseline preference for B (baselineB) acts as a prior in logit space.
    - Lapses mix probability with random choice.

    Parameters (all used):
    - power: [0,1] curvature on validity; lower values flatten cue weights, higher values sharpen them.
    - sparsity: [0,1] mixes distributed vs winner-take-all attention across cues.
    - conflict_aversion: [0,1] reduces effective temperature in proportion to cue conflict.
    - baselineB: [0,1] baseline preference for B; centered around 0.5 and applied in logits.
    - epsilon: [0,1] lapse rate; mixes the model probability with random choice (0.5).
    - temperature: [0,10] base inverse temperature before conflict adaptation.

    Inputs:
